# Overview

[Islandora](https://islandora.ca) is an open-source framework that provides the necessary tools to turn a [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) website into a fully-functional Digital Assets Management System.

## About

Islandora:

[//]: # (We should probably replace as many of the links in this section as possible with links to within this documentation, and make it clear which are internal links and which link out.)
- **Is native Drupal** - With Islandora, you can create preservation-ready digital resources using Drupal nodes, media, files, and taxonomy terms. A suite of customized Drupal resource types and configurations that illustrate Islandora's capabilities are packaged as the [Islandora Defaults module](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_defaults).
- **Integrates with Fedora** - Drupal resources can be stored in Duraspace's [Fedora 5.x Repository](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FF/Fedora+Repository+Home) as binary assets and RDF metadata.
- **Uses microservices** - Islandora provides an architecture for messaging and integration with any number of microservices, that provide services outside of the Drupal framework. Islandora's [Crayfish](https://github.com/Islandora/crayfish) suite of microservices provides functionality for synchronizing resources into Fedora and automatically generating derivative files.
- **Can handle messages at scale** - Islandora uses [Alpaca](https://github.com/Islandora/Alpaca), an integration middleware based on Apache Camel, to scalably handle messaging and queueing for microservices such as Crayfish.
[//]: # (Allowing bulk uploads to be processed without affecting the server... would be the ideal right? but right now they're on the same server. Is just saying "scalability" ok?)
- **Offers digital preservation features** - Using a robust storage layer for preservation (Fedora), and generating technical metadata with FITS, are digital preservation tools provided out of the box in the default implementation. Community members have created additional features for doing [digital preservation using Islandora](https://github.com/mjordan/digital_preservation_using_islandora), which have not yet been contributed to "Core Islandora". 
- **Exposes data to harvesters** - Metadata about resources is available as linked data through the [JSON-LD serialization module](https://github.com/Islandora/jsonld), and can be made available through Drupal, Fedora, or a triplestore. Islandora also offers a [full configuration for exposing OAI-PMH](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_defaults/tree/8.x-1.x/modules/islandora_oaipmh) to metadata harvesters, and [IIIF support](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora/tree/8.x-1.x/modules/islandora_iiif) for images.
- **Offers flexibility** - As Islandora content is Drupal content, migrations and batch editing can be done through Drupal's built-in migrate framework and controlled vocabularies created using Drupal taxonomies. Contributed Drupal modules such as [Solr Search API](https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api_solr) enable in-site search, and [Matomo Analytics](https://www.drupal.org/project/matomo) provides usage metrics for site analytics.
- **Is a community** - A [dedicated, active community of users and developers](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/islandora) is working to push new features, collaborate on improvements, design custom solutions, and create extended functionality. Some of these for Islandora 8 take the form of [Recipes](https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/Islandora-Cookbook).

## Try Islandora

### Sandbox

To try Islandora without installing anything, visit [http://future.islandora.ca/](http://future.islandora.ca/). Anyone can log in to this sandbox as an administrator (credentials are below and on the front page) and explore the interface! However, this site is refreshed periodically so your changes will not be permanent. This site uses Islandora Defaults, a way of setting up Islandora for demonstration purposes - this is not the only way that Islandora can be made to work!

- password: islandora

### Virtual Machine Image

To try Islandora locally, you can download and run the latest [community sandbox VM image](https://islandora.ca/try). This requires installing VirtualBox or another virtualization provider. This also uses Islandora Defaults, as it is a pre-built version of the Islandora Playbook.

- username: admin
- password: islandora

### Islandora Base Box via Vagrant

If you have Vagrant and Git installed as well as VirtualBox, you can spin up the latest release of Islandora Defaults using the [Islandora Playbook](https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/islandora-playbook)'s Vagrantfile. Out of the box, `vagrant up` will download the latest release of Islandora as the [Islandora 8 Base Box](https://app.vagrantup.com/islandora/boxes/8). It will also set up shared folders and port forwarding, but (as of June 2020) will not do any Ansible Provisioning, because the Islandora 8 Base Box has been already provisioned. Same credentials as above, with further documented in its README file.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/islandora-playbook
cd islandora-playbook
vagrant up
```

### Islandora Playbook via Ansible

To use the Islandora Playbook as an Ansible Playbook, either edit the included Vagrantfile to use `ubuntu/bionic64` or `centos/7` rather than the pre-built `islandora/8` base box, or, use Ansible to run it against an external linux server. Either way, be prepared to wait a while as Ansible installs Drupal via drupal-project and Composer. See [Installation](installation/playbook) for more details.
