# Repository

In Islandora, a repository is a collection of digital items - including files and/or metadata - that will be managed/preserved. Repositories may have different lifespans and purposes. Examples of repositories include:

- an institutional repository containing theses and dissertations published by the host institution.
- a collection of historical artifacts which have been digitized and are being put on display.

The forthcoming "Use cases" section will include elaboration of common repository needs based on repository type (such as IR needs, multitenant needs, exhibit needs, etc).

A repository may have, or not have, various features such as the following: 

- access control
- revisioning
- checksum checking
- derivatives (lower-quality service files) created automatically.

See the forthcoming "Features" section for more features that Islandora can provide.

Islandora uses Drupal as a repository software, and makes use where possible of Drupal's core and contributed modules. In Islandora, your Drupal site *is* a repository.
